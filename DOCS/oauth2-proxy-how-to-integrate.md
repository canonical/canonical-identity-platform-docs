# Integrate your Charmed Operator with Identity and Access Proxy

Applications that do not conform to OAuth/OIDC standards or don't offer built-in access control
can be secured using the Identity and Access Proxy (IAP) solution, which offers a possibility to protect application endpoints
by intercepting incoming requests and delegating the authn/authz process to the relevant components of the [Identity Platform](https://charmhub.io/identity-platform).

OAuth2 Proxy is the main entrypoint to plug the Identity and Access Proxy to your charmed operator. It can be achieved using the power of juju relations.

This guide will explain how to extend the Identity Platform with the Identity and Access Proxy solution
and integrate it with your charm, allowing you to restrict access to your application to authenticated users only.

We are going to assume that:
1. Your charmed application doesn't support the OAuth 2.0/OIDC protocols, otherwise refer to [this](https://charmhub.io/topics/canonical-identity-platform/how-to/integrate-oidc-compatible-charms) guide instead.
2. Your charmed application supports integration with Charmed Traefik via `ingress-per-app` or `ingress-per-unit` interface 
and provides Charmed OAuth2 Proxy with necessary data by supporting the `auth_proxy` interface.
3. You have deployed the [Identity Platform](https://charmhub.io/topics/canonical-identity-platform/tutorials/e2e-tutorial).
4. You have deployed your charmed application on Kubernetes.

This deployment should be your starting point:
```

```

In this guide we are going to assume you also deployed your charmed application in `iam` model.

In order to set up the proxy, you first need to expose `forward-auth` offer, enable the feature in Charmed Traefik
and integrate it with your charm via ingress relation:
```commandline
juju config traefik-public enable_experimental_forward_auth=True -m core
juju offer traefik-public:experimental-forward-auth forward-auth -m core
juju integrate your-charm admin/core.ingress -m iam
```

The next step is to deploy Charmed OAuth2 Proxy and integrate it with Charmed Traefik with the exposed offer:
```commandline
juju deploy oauth2-proxy-k8s --channel latest/stable --trust -m iam
juju integrate oauth2-proxy:forward-auth admin/core.forward-auth -m iam
```

You can follow the deployment status with `watch -c juju status --color`.

Then, integrate your charm with the proxy by running:
```commandline
juju integrate oauth2-proxy-k8s your-charm:auth-proxy -m iam
```

Finally, integrate the proxy with Identity Platform's OIDC provider - Charmed Hydra:
```commandline
juju integrate oauth2-proxy-k8s:oauth hydra -m iam
```

When you access your application, Charmed Traefik will ask OAuth2 Proxy whether access to the endpoint is protected.
If so, it will check if there is a valid session. In case it doesn't find one, it will redirect to the Identity Platform login page.
Upon successful authentication, you will be redirected back to your application.
