# Integrate with OpenFGA

If you are charming an application that supports using OpenFGA for authorization, you can integrate with the [OpenFGA charm](https://charmhub.io/openfga-k8s) to automatically create a store that will persist even if the relation is gone.

## Add an integration endpoint to metadata.yaml

The OpenFGA store information is communicated over relation data, where the OpenFGA charm is the provider and the application is the requirer. For consistency accross the ecosystem, it is encouraged to name the relation `openfga`.

Edit your charmâ€™s metadata.yaml to add, under provides, the following:

```
requires:
    # any other providers your charm supports
    openfga:
        interface: openfga
```

## Fetch the openfga charm library

The OpenFGA charm will create a store per openfga relation, which is managed by the openfga library.

charmcraft fetch-lib charms.openfga_k8s.v1.openfga

The library offers a OpenFGARequires object, which provides sensible defaults and a simple API that you can use to connect with the OpenFGA server.

## Use `OpenFGARequires`

To initialise the library:

```
class SomeCharm(CharmBase):
  def __init__(self, *args):
    self.openfga = OpenFGARequires(self, "test-openfga-store")
    self.framework.observe(
        self.openfga.on.openfga_store_created,
        self._on_openfga_store_created,
    )
    ...

    def _on_openfga_store_created(self, event: OpenFGAStoreCreateEvent):
        if not event.store_id:
            return

        info = self.openfga.get_store_info()
        if not info:
            return

        logger.info("store id {}".format(info.store_id))
        logger.info("token {}".format(info.token))
        logger.info("grpc_api_url {}".format(info.grpc_api_url))
        logger.info("http_api_url {}".format(info.http_api_url))
        ...

```

When this charm is related with OpenFGA with:

```
juju integrate openfga:openfga some-charm:openfga
```

The OpenFGA charm will create a new store with the name `test-openfga-store` and provide the store id, along with any information needed to connect to the server in the databag.

If the relation is removed:

```
juju remove-relation openfga:openfga some-charm:openfga
```

The store will not be removed and the same store will be provided if the same charm is related with openfga. To achieve this, the OpenFGA charm assumes that the store-name requested by the application is unique.
