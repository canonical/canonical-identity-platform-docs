`OpenFGA` is a [Kubernetes charm](https://juju.is/docs/olm/charmed-operator) for [OpenFGA](https://github.com/openfga/openfga)


A high-performance and flexible authorization/permission engine built for developers and inspired by [Google Zanzibar](https://zanzibar.academy/).

OpenFGA is designed to make it easy for developers to model their application permissions and add and integrate fine-grained authorization into their applications.
It allows in-memory data storage for quick development, as well as pluggable database modules. 

The operator currently only supports PostgreSQL.
