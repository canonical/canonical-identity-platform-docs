This tutorial aims to provide a general walkthrough to set up a fully working
GLAuth server using `glauth-k8s` charmed operator, MicroK8s, and Juju.

# Set up the environment

Follow
this [guide](https://juju.is/docs/juju/set-up--tear-down-your-test-environment)
to bootstrap a MicroK8s cloud running a Juju controller.

Create a Juju model:

```shell
juju add-model dev
```

## Deploy prerequisite charmed operators

The `glauth-k8s` charmed operator requires the following charmed operators
deployed in the MicroK8s cluster:

- [`postgresql-k8s-operator`](https://charmhub.io/postgresql-k8s)
- [`self-signed-certificates-operator`](https://charmhub.io/self-signed-certificates)

```shell
juju deploy postgresql-k8s --channel 14/stable --trust

juju deploy self-signed-certificates
```

## Deploy `glauth-k8s` charmed operator

The `glauth-k8s` charmed operator can be deployed as follows:

```shell
juju deploy glauth-k8s --channel edge --trust
```

## Integrate with other charmed operators

The `glauth-k8s` charmed operator needs to integrate with the `postgresql-k8s`
and `self-signed-certificates` charmed operators to reach `active` state:

```shell
juju integrate glauth-k8s postgresql-k8s

juju integrate glauth-k8s self-signed-certificates
```

The `glauth-k8s` charmed operator offers the `ldap` integration with any LDAP
client charmed operator following the `ldap` interface protocol. Assuming we
have deployed such a client charmed operator, we can proceed to integrate it
with the `glauth-k8s`:

```shell
juju integrate <client-charm>:ldap glauth-k8s:ldap
```

The GLAuth supports the `StartTLS` operation, and the `glauth-k8s` charmed
operator enables it by default. In order to allow the client to trust the
self-signed certificates, we need to integrate the client charmed operator with
the `glauth-k8s` charmed operator for the `certificate_transfer` interface
protocol:

```shell
juju integrate <client-charm>:send-ca-cert glauth-k8s:send-ca-cert
```

Furthermore,
the [`glauth-utils` charmed operator](https://charmhub.io/glauth-utils) allows
us to apply data changes by using
the [LDIF](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2849). To integrate with
the `glauth-utils`:

```shell
juju deploy glauth-utils --channel edge --trust

juju integrate glauth-k8s glauth-utils
```

A sample of supported LDIF content records can be
found [here](https://github.com/canonical/glauth-utils/blob/main/SAMPLES.md).

We now should be able to reach to the following deployment status:

```shell
$ juju status --relations

# Tear down

Remove the `dev` Juju model:

```shell
juju destroy-model openfga
```
