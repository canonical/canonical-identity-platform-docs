# How to onboard an application with Charmed Hydra

> This guide assumes that your application supports OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect (OIDC) protocols.
> If your application has not yet adopted these standards, you’ll first need to:
> - Enable your application to make an authorization request to an OAuth Server.
> - Implement a callback endpoint (`redirect_uri`) that captures the authorization code received from the OAuth 2.0 Server (Hydra) and exchanges it for tokens.

[note]

The recommended libraries include:
- Go: [oauth2](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/oauth2) and [oidc](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/coreos/go-oidc/v3/oidc)
- Python: [authlib](https://github.com/authlib/authlib), [oauthlib](https://github.com/oauthlib/oauthlib), [pyjwt](https://github.com/jpadilla/pyjwt), [python-jose](https://github.com/mpdavis/python-jose)

[/note]

To let your application authenticate with the Identity Platform, you must register it as an OAuth client in Hydra - the OAuth 2.0 and OIDC Server.

You can do this in one of two ways:
- integrate your charmed application with [`oauth`](https://github.com/canonical/charm-relation-interfaces/tree/main/interfaces/oauth/v0) interface
- use the `create-oauth-client` Juju action provided by [Charmed Hydra](https://charmhub.io/hydra).

> The preferred approach is to integrate your charmed application with Hydra through the `oauth` interface, which automatically manages client registration based on the provided configuration.

The Juju action and `oauth` interface offer the following parameters:
- `audience`: A list of the audiences your client is allowed to request.
- `grant-types`: A list of allowed grant types. Default: `["authorization_code"]`
- `redirect-uris`: A list of your application's callback URLs that Hydra is allowed to redirect to.
- `response-types`: A list of the allowed response types for the client. Default: `["code"]`
- `scope`: A list of scopes the client is allowed to request. Refer to [this](https://auth0.com/docs/get-started/apis/scopes/openid-connect-scopes) article for more information. Default: `["openid", "profile", "email", "phone"]`
- `token-endpoint-auth-method`: The authentication method the client is allowed to use at the token endpoint. One of `client_secret_post`, `client_secret_basic`, `none` (for public clients)
- `client-secret`: You can optionally provide a secret for your confidential client. If not provided, one will be autogenerated.

You can find detailed explanations of these parameters in the [OIDC documentation](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-registration-1_0.html#ClientMetadata).

### Choosing the right grant type(s)

Depending on what your application does, you’ll need to choose one or more grant types:

- For human users interacting via browser-based flows, use the `authorization_code` grant type.
- For machine-to-machine authentication and service accounts, use the `client_credentials` grant type.  
- Devices with limited input (TVs, consoles, ...) can leverage the `urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:device_code` grant type to enable the device flow.
- The `refresh_token` grant type allows your app to get new access tokens without requiring the user to re-authenticate.

[note]

You can define multiple grant types for a single client by specifying them as a list (e.g. `["authorization_code", "refresh_token"]`), allowing the client to support multiple OAuth flows.

## Register your OAuth client

Once you know the right grant types and other parameters, run the `create-oauth-client` action:

```bash
juju run hydra/leader create-oauth-client \
  grant-types='["authorization_code","refresh_token"]' \
  redirect-uris='["https://your-app.example.com/callback"]' \
  response-types='["code"]' \
  scope='["openid","profile","email"]' \
  token-endpoint-auth-method="client_secret_basic"
```

The action will return your new client's ID and secret, which you can use to configure your application.

## Update your OAuth client

If needed, you can update your client configuration by running:

```bash
juju run hydra/leader update-oauth-client \
  client-id="your-client-id" \
  client-secret="your-client-secret" \
  grant-types='["authorization_code","refresh_token"]' \
  redirect-uris='["https://your-app.example.com/callback"]' \
  response-types='["code"]' \
  scope='["openid","profile","email"]' \
  token-endpoint-auth-method="client_secret_basic"
```

Note that any parameters you omit will be reset to their default values.

## Delete your OAuth client

You can delete your OAuth client with:

```bash
juju run hydra/leader delete-oauth-client \
  client-id="your-client-id"
```
