Charmed OpenFGA
===============

``OpenFGA`` is a `Kubernetes charm <https://documentation.ubuntu.com/juju/3.6/explanation/charms-vs-kubernetes-operators/>`_ for `OpenFGA <https://github.com/openfga/openfga>`_.

It is a high-performance and flexible authorization/permission engine built for developers and inspired by `Google Zanzibar <https://zanzibar.academy/>`_.

OpenFGA is designed to make it easy for developers to model their application permissions and integrate fine-grained authorization into their applications. While it allows in-memory data storage for quick development, this operator currently supports **PostgreSQL** for production-grade persistence.
