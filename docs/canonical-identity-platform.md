# Canonical Identity Platform

Composable identity provider and identity broker system based on [Juju](http://juju.is).

The Canonical Identity Platform is the simplest way to add single sign on (SSO) for charmed workloads and centralized authentication, authorisation and access governance controls.

The Canonical Identity Platform uses best of breed open source software to provide:
- The ability to configure SSO with third party, OIDC compliant identity providers (e.g. Azure AD, Google, Okta, etc.)
- A standard compliant compliant OAuth/OIDC server 
- User and client management functionalities
- A relationship based access control (ReBAC) backend
- A login UI and error pages

While primarily designed for charmed workloads the Canonical Identity Platform can also be used to protect traditional Kubernetes and Virtual Machine based applications.
